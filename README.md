# Depth-and-Longitudinal-Control-of-HAUV

The project consists of developing a full state feedback controller system that can control the depth and the longitudinal position of a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (H-AUV). 
Also a LQR controller has been developed for tracking the trajectory of the H-AUV. More information regarding the project can be found in the project report attached.
